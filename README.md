# Final Project Machine Learning
In this repository I have included twosubmission files; (1) .Rmd and the (2) Knitted .html output file

# Locations of the sumission files
The .Rmd file is in the master branch. [Click here](https://github.com/jtgharp/FinalProjectMachineLearning/blob/master/MLProject.Rmd)
The knitr produced HTML file is in the gh-pages branch. It is [here](https://jtgharp.github.io/FinalProjectMachineLearning/)
While clicking each link above if you right click to open in separate tabs i your browser then you can open each in two separate tabs and compare the code in the .Rmd file with the out put generated in the Knitr produced HTML file.
