# Final Project Machine Learning - Coursera
In this repository I have included three submission files;  
  (1) .Rmd file, 
  (2) Knitted .html output file,  and
  (3) allanswers.txt file.    
  I was not sure if I should include this last file. But just wanted to make sure that I do not lose any points in grading by my peers so including it.
  
  # Note
