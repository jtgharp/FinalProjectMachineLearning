# Final Project Machine Learning
In this repository I have included three submission files;

  (1) .Rmd and the (2) Knitted .html output file  and (3) allanswers.txt file.  I was not sure if I should include this last file. But just wanted to make sure that I do not lose any points in grading by my peers so including it.

# Locations of the sumission files
The .Rmd file is in the master branch. [Click here for Rmd file](https://github.com/jtgharp/FinalProjectMachineLearning/blob/master/MLProject.Rmd)  

The knitr produced HTML file is in the gh-pages branch. [Click here for HTML output file](https://jtgharp.github.io/FinalProjectMachineLearning/)    

All the naswers are in the file named allanswers.txt.  [Click here for all answers](https://github.com/jtgharp/FinalProjectMachineLearning/blob/master/allanswers.txt)
While clicking each link above if you right click to open in separate tabs i your browser then you can open each in two separate tabs and compare the code in the .Rmd file with the out put generated in the Knitr produced HTML file.
